# time-tracker

A coding test to a company with following requirements:

Develop a simple web application similar to our personnel page. It is important that it is functional and that it imitates our app's design structure.

Application requirements
• Be able to log in with social security number and password
• Editing of user data (Change password)
• Stamp in and out according to the current time (Time registrations)
• Have an overview of saved in and out stamps
• Be able to save the device's current GPS coordinates on the time records
• Editing possibilities for saved time registrations
• Simple validation of time registrations so that these do not overlap with each other
Development requirements
• The "frontend" part must be built in typescript and vue3 ( Vite )
• All pages must be mobile-friendly and able to scale according to screen size
• Data must be sent to and from the client using REST principles

You can choose freely when it comes to programming libraries that facilitate development, e.g
authentication package, time management package, Css, etc. You don't need to show Gps
coordinates on a map as these services often cost money to use. Users can be added manually and no registration form to is needed.
